Introduction:

In our world, where people highly value their belongings, everyone wants to protect what they have. When the COVID-19 pandemic started, many countries faced challenges in getting vaccines to protect their citizens. Just like how people rush to get a vaccine to safeguard themselves, the idea behind insurance is similar. People are willing to pay money to protect themselves from unexpected losses.

In the United States, the insurance industry is worth a massive 1.28 trillion dollars. Unfortunately, about 80 billion dollars are lost each year due to insurance fraud in the U.S. This fraud causes insurance companies to raise their policy costs, making them less competitive. Higher costs also mean people have to pay more for insurance policies.

This project aims to find the best and simplest way to fight against fraudulent insurance claims. The main issue in identifying fraud is the large number of claims processed by insurance companies. However, this large amount of data could be an advantage. If officials combine and analyze this data, they can create better models to identify suspicious claims.

The project will explore different methods used to solve similar problems, testing and comparing them to find the most effective approach. The goal is to build a simple, quick, and accurate model that can flag suspicious claims without causing stress to the system.

Problem statement:

This project's main goal is to create a model that can figure out if an insurance claim is a fraud or not. We'll test different methods to find the best one for this job. The idea is to present this model to insurance companies, suggesting they use a personalized version for their systems. The model should be easy to use for large sets of data but still smart enough to be quite successful in spotting fraud.


Models Implemented:

1.Logistic Regression Model
2.Decision tree Model
3.Random Forest Model
4.Isolation Forest Model
